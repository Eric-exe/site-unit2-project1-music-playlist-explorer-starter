### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the topics discussed in the labs partially helped me complete the assignment. The labs went over the contents on a surface level and encouraged me to search
the web for the answers to the questions I was looking for as the labs themselves didn't contribute too much to the assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would've implemented all of the stretch features. A good portion of the time I spent was reformatting the JavaScript to work with more and more features. In hindsight, I should've read through the entire implementation requirements so that I had a good idea of how specific functions need to be to support all of the stretch features.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project overall went well as I did complete the core features. However, I didn't get to complete all of the stretch features in part because I was helping my peers resolve their issues. This did cut a huge chunk of my own development time. To fix this in the future, I will try to prioritize my time and learn when to help others and when to let others find the answer to their own errors instead of helping them by actively debugging.
